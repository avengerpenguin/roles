    <p>The Dictator wants order around them, but lacks the ability to know the best way to do that and therefore resorts to trying to control others. This can sometimes be a role played as a projection when you doubt your ability to play <a href="/it-3">The Reasoner</a> role. That is, you are not trying to control disorder in others, but believed disorder and illogic in yourself in that role.</p>
