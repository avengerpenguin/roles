    <p>The Prototyper is a temporary role played by someone normally comfortable playing <a href="/ep-f">The Disruptor</a>. They are more motivated to carry forward one or many of the ideas The Disruptor has to improve a situation, system or the world. It is a role played when we take a bias to action and start asking how to decisively run with an idea or two, even if in a small way.</p>
<p>Since The Prototyper is less comfortable with taking action as much as <a href="/ej-f">The Driver</a>, it is usually recommended to stick to small, incremental acts of trying out ideas and then get feed back for <a href="/ep-f">The Disruptor</a> to assess.</p>
