Title: Prototyper

The Prototyper is a temporary role played by someone normally comfortable playing [[EP-f|The Disruptor]]. They are more motivated to carry forward one or many of the ideas The Disruptor has to improve a situation, system or the world. It is a role played when we take a bias to action and start asking how to decisively run with an idea or two, even if in a small way.

Since The Prototyper is less comfortable with taking action as much as [[EJ-f|The Driver]], it is usually recommended to stick to small, incremental acts of trying out ideas and then get feed back for [[EP-f|The Disruptor]] to assess.
