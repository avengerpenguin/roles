Title: Serendipity

The Serendipity muse strikes someone who normally plays the [[IN-1|Dreamscaper]] role when something outside of their own imagination piques their curiosity and they briefly go down a rabbit hole of exploring new information. This muse inspires The Dreamscaper to behave a little like [[EN-1|The Seeker]], but not nearly as fluently and intensely.

This muse can then inspire shifting into either [[IT-3|The Reasoner]] to make sense of the new information (for the [[INFJ]]) or playing [[IF-3]] ([[INTJ]]).
