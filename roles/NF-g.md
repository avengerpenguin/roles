Title: The Dreamer

The Dreamer is a role temporarily played by someone who normally subscribes to the beliefs and worldview of [[NT-f|The Innovator]] role. It is played when The Innovator opens their mind a little further and maybe suspends sticking to the "possible" and flirts with more far-out or even impossible ideas.

With the natural restraint and desire to come back to playing The Innovator, this has the potential to give The Innovator even more ideas and broaden their intuition. There isn't too much risk of being as unrealstic as [[NF-f|The Idealist]] can be, but it would do well for Innovators to spend some time around Idealists to study for playing The Dreamer role when they wish to grow and expand their worldview.

The negative thing to watch for is whether suspending the rationality of The Innovator role is actually arising from some crisis of identity where The Innovator loses trust in their ability and the player suspends rationality and trust in their intution not to entertain playing The Dreamer, but actually to descend into playing [[SF-s|The Attention-Seeker]].
