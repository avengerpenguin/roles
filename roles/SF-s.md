Title: The Attention-Seeker

The Attention-Seeker is played by someone who normally subscribes to the worldview of playing [[NT-f|The Innovator]] role as much as possible, but they have perhaps lost trust in their ability to play that role.

Instead, they suspect their rationalality, objectivity and trust in their intuiation to instead seek subjective feedback from experiences, social interactions or memories that validates their self-worth.

This is distinct from [[SF-f|The Communitarian]] whose identity primarily comes from interpersonal interactions and experiences because those playing that role are comfortable with that identity. They are not looking to boost their ego with these interactions because engaging with others like this is part of their ego and balanced out by other roles they can play.

Descending into The Attention-Seeker might feel to The Innovator they are playing The Communitarian, but it's more likely to be to validate their ego or even to seek affirmations from people of their intuitive and rational intelligence.

If playing The Innovator doesn't seem to helping a situation, a healthier approach might be playing [[NF-g|The Dreamer]] role where you connect with yourself and others emotionally to embrace subjectivity in your approach.

Alternatively, if you are trying to help someone else, consider playing [[ST-m|The Realist]] where you collect real data from past or present experiences and use your rationality to make sense of them. This might be useful, for example, if the person you're helping doesn't need The Innovator helping solving abstract problems and instead needs a specific issue addressed.
