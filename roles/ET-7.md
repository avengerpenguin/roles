Title: The Dictator

The Dictator wants order around them, but lacks the ability to know the best way to do that and therefore resorts to trying to control others. This can sometimes be a role played as a projection when you doubt your ability to play [[IT-3|The Reasoner]] role. That is, you are not trying to control disorder in others, but believed disorder and illogic in yourself in that role.
