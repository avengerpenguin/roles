## The Leader: {{ roles.leader.name }}

The leader of your realm is the {{ roles.leader.name }}.

> {{ roles.flow.leader.description}}

The leader generally helps you in three
ways:

### Natural Flow

This is one of up to six roles you can play when you want to be in a state of
"flow". This particular flow role is perhaps your most natural. This is because
it one of the most effortless to use, so you can use it with confidence and
without fear.

### Your Heroic Self

It is part of your ego, so it a true part of who you are. You do not normally
need any rewards for playing this role as simply playing it is reward enough.

Acting in this role can feel like really being on yourself and being on a
heroic quest.

### Supporting Growth

When you want to grow and develop, the {{ roles.leader.name }} should no longer
be in charge, but instead kept to the side to be used, but taken less seriously.
Take inspiration from those that play {{ roles.leader.name }} as their
jester role naturally:

## The Adviser: {{ roles.adviser.name }}

While the {{ roles.leader.name }} is in charge, they are advised and somewhat
mentored by a wiser {{ roles.adviser.name }}. Your {{ roles.leader.name }}
looks up to the {{ roles.adviser.name }} as an aspirational or ideal self. This
is because while you are able to play the {{ roles.adviser.name }} role quite
easily, it's still not quite as natural as being the {{ roles.leader.name }},
but the adviser is close enough that it has a huge influence in how your
rule your realm overall.

> {{ roles.leader.description}}

This is not a "flow" role for you are stepping outside of your natural self a
little (your lead wouldn't need an adviser if this came naturally), so you
will want to return to playing a flow role for rest. This role is useful to
you in two ways however:

### Purpose

While you can very naturally play the {{ roles.leader.name }} role, when you
combine it with the {{ roles.adviser.name }}, you have a fuller sense of
purpose and confidence. This is because playing only the {{ roles.leader.name }}
only solves very narrow or one-dimensional issues. It is when the
{{ roles.leader.name }} and the {{ roles.adviser.name }} work together that
you can work on real projects or missions.

### Mentoring others

Your {{ roles.adviser.name }} mentor can help you even further when you play
that role to mentor others. It's likely your "best self" to bring when you want
to help someone else through a problem or when you are responsible for someone
else like a child or even a client.

To take inspiration from those for whom the {{ roles.adviser.name }} is a more
natural role:

## Growth

When trying to grow, you need to change how you use weaker roles and also need
to treat some of your preferred roles differently.

In general:

* Your hero/natural role of {{ roles.leader.name }} needs to be used more
  playfully.
* Your ideal role needs put on hold unless needed for a specific problem.
* Your apprentice role should become your default role as this is where you are
  weaker, but actively learning is a key area for growth.
* Your warrior role...
* Your muse role should be tapped into more to support your apprentice role.
* Your playful role should be locked away for time you're in growth state (and
  let out again to play when you rest).
* Your parent role should be brought to the table for inspiration.
* Your prisoner role should be freed for a bit to provide some useful lessons
  and learning.
