    <p>The Hedonist is the role that can only seem to enjoy life and be present when it involves dropping everything else.  While it is ok to "let loose" and enjoy physical and sensory pleasures, the fact is comes at the expense of better judgements makes it hard to avoid excess.</p>
<p>This role can be played unintentionally at times of stress, especially when <a href="/en-1">The Seeker</a> has abandoned trust in being able to see opportunities or when a severe lack of novely/stimulation has left The Seeker unfulfilled.</p>
<p>However, when this role is looked to now and again it can balance out overplaying roles like <a href="/it-2">The Scientist</a> by providing external, tangible experiences that might even expand the horizon of what The Scientist believes they already know.</p>
<p>This dynamic is seen in a less destructive way in those that play <a href="/es-2">ES-2</a> as a mentor role to <a href="/it-1">The Logician</a>. The more natural ability to let loose without abandoning all other roles allows ES-2 to "mellow out" The Logician and ground their analytical skills in solving tangible, mechanical problems.</p>
<p>This role is played by the <a href="/entp">ENTP</a> or the <a href="/enfp">ENFP</a>.</p>
