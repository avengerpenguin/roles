    <p>The Rebel resists all forms of control. Even at the mere suggestion that someone is trying to control them, they will fight it. This works when well used at the right time to assert autonomy and self-control, but playing this role too much or when it isn't need can be overly combative.</p>
<p>This role is sometimes played by the <a href="/entp">ENTP</a> or the <a href="/estp">ESTP</a>.</p>
